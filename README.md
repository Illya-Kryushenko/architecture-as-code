# executable-architecture
Structured architecture models linked to CAF, Zero Trust, and Infrastructure as Code

## Overview

This repository captures the initial concept of transforming architecture from static documentation into a structured, traceable, and partially executable model.

The current starting point is Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) and Zero Trust guidance. The core idea is to transform architectural guidance into machine-readable templates that can be linked to architecture models, Infrastructure as Code, validation, and drift detection.

The initial focus is Security Architecture, where the structure is stronger and the relationships between risk, control, and implementation are clearer.

## Problem

Modern cloud environments have a structural gap between:

- architectural intent
- architectural guidance
- implementation in IaC
- deployed reality

Architecture documents explain intent, but become outdated.
IaC accurately describes implementation, but does not explain why the system is built this way.

As a result, organizations struggle with:

- architectural drift
- weak traceability
- poor alignment between decisions and implementation
- manual and inconsistent validation of architecture

## Core Idea

The proposed model introduces an architecture layer that sits above IaC and connects:

- guidance
- constraints
- requirements
- architecture decisions
- implementation mappings
- validation rules

The long-term direction is to move from architecture as static text to architecture as a living, structured, and verifiable model.

## Initial Direction

The first practical scope is:

- CAF and Zero Trust as executable templates
- Security Architecture as the first implementation domain
- human-readable architecture documents generated from a structured model
- support for both canonical architecture data and human commentary
- later validation against IaC and deployed state

## Guiding Principles

- The architecture model is the primary source of truth
- Human-readable documents are generated views of the model
- Structured content defines architecture
- Commentary explains architecture
- Commentary must not replace canonical architectural facts

## Repository Scope

This repository currently contains:

- concept notes
- initial ADRs
- evolving structure for an executable architecture model

## Status

Early concept exploration.
