# Architecture Model (v1)

This document defines the core elements of the Architecture as Code (AaC) model, their relationships, and how they map to implementation and validation.

---

## Core Elements

### Risk
A potential threat or vulnerability that could compromise the system.

**Fields:**
- `id` – unique identifier (e.g., R-001)
- `name` – short description
- `control_objective` – high‑level goal that, if achieved, mitigates the risk (conceptually a Control Objective, but stored on the risk for simplicity).
- `controls` – list of controls that address this risk

### Control
A specific technical or procedural mechanism that implements the control objective.

**Fields:**
- `id` – unique identifier (e.g., C-001)
- `name` – short description
- `type` – e.g., TechnicalControl
- `constraints` – list of specific requirements

### Constraint
A concrete requirement that the implementation must satisfy.

**Fields:**
- `id` – unique identifier (e.g., CON-001)
- `description` – precise statement

### Implementation Mapping
Links a control to actual infrastructure resources (IaC).

**Fields:**
- `control_id` – reference to a control
- `resource_type` – Terraform resource type (e.g., `azurerm_windows_virtual_machine`)
- `tags` – required tags on the resource
- `parameters` – required configuration parameters

### Validation
The process of checking whether the implementation matches the model.

**Current approach:** validation against Terraform state, including resource type, tags, and selected parameters (see [validator](../aac/validator.py))

## Example

See [`examples/basic-model.yaml`](../examples/basic-model.yaml) for a complete example.

The example implements the following chain:

**Risk (R-001):** Privilege escalation via compromised admin endpoint  
↓  
**Control Objective:** Ensure privileged access originates only from trusted and managed devices  
↓  
**Control (C-001):** Privileged Access Workstation (PAW)  
↓  
**Constraint (CON-001):** Admin roles require compliant devices  
↓  
**Implementation Mapping:**  
- `azurerm_windows_virtual_machine` with `tags.role = PAW`  
- `azurerm_conditional_access_policy` with `parameters.grant_controls = ["requireCompliantDevice"]`  
↓  
**Validation:** Check that these resources exist in Terraform state and match required tags and parameters

**Current prototype coverage:** The current prototype validates Terraform-managed resources against the model using resource type, tags, and selected parameters. Some identity-layer controls such as Conditional Access may be modeled but remain outside the observable scope of the provided Terraform state.

The model includes multiple controls linked to the same risk (C-001 to C-004), demonstrating different validation outcomes:

- `FAILED` control (C-001): one mapping fails by parameter mismatch and another is missing
- `INCOMPLETE` control (C-002): one mapping passes and another is missing
- `FAILED` control (C-003): a mapping fails by tag mismatch
- `MISSING` control (C-004): all mappings are missing
- `EXPOSED` risk (R-001): not all linked controls are covered

---

## Relationships

- A **Risk** is associated with a control_objective, which is conceptually implemented by one or more **Controls**.

- In the current model, **Controls are the primary link between risks and implementation**.

- A **Control** has one or more **Constraints**.
- A **Control** is linked to infrastructure via **Implementation Mappings**.

- **Validation** checks that Implementation Mappings match actual Terraform state.

---

## Validation Semantics

In the current prototype, validation is evaluated at three levels:

### Mapping level
Each implementation mapping is evaluated as:
- `PASS` – a matching resource was found and required tags and parameters matched
- `FAIL` – a resource of the expected type was found, but required tags or parameters did not match
- `MISSING` – no resource of the required type was found in the provided Terraform state

### Control level
A control status is derived from the results of all its implementation mappings:
- `COVERED` – all mappings passed
- `FAILED` – at least one mapping failed
- `INCOMPLETE` – some mappings passed, but others are missing
- `MISSING` – all mappings are missing

### Risk level
A risk is evaluated based on its linked controls:
- `COVERED` – all linked controls are covered
- `EXPOSED` – one or more linked controls are not covered

## Open Standard

This model is versioned and open to change.
