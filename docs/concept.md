# Concept

## Working title

Executable Architecture for CAF and Zero Trust

## Core hypothesis

It should be possible to transform architecture from descriptive guidance into a structured, machine-readable, and partially enforceable model.

## Initial motivation

Infrastructure as Code solved deployment reproducibility, but did not solve the architectural gap between:

- intent
- decisions
- implementation
- validation

This idea attempts to create a bridge between those layers.

## Initial focus

The first focus area is Security Architecture because it provides:

- stronger structure
- clearer constraints
- better traceability
- higher validation value

## Initial chain

A central chain in the model is:

Risk → Control Objective → Control → Implementation → Signal

This allows the model to connect architecture with deployed reality and verification.

## Human and machine representation

Architecture should exist in two forms:

1. Structured model for processing and validation
2. Human-readable documentation for understanding

The model is canonical.
The human-readable document is a rendered projection of the model.

However, the document may also contain explicit commentary blocks written by humans.

These commentary blocks are intended for:

- rationale
- assumptions
- trade-offs
- caveats
- operational notes

They must not define mandatory architectural truth.
Canonical facts must remain in the model.

## Template direction

A practical starting point is to define architecture templates based on Microsoft guidance such as:

- CAF landing zones
- Zero Trust identity patterns
- PAW / privileged access controls
- Key Vault boundary patterns
- Conditional Access and PIM requirements

## Possible future directions

- architecture-to-IaC traceability
- baseline IaC generation from structured architecture
- drift detection
- compliance templates
- open template ecosystem
- extension from security architecture to broader infrastructure architecture
