# Architecture as Code (AaC) for CAF and Zero Trust
*A proposal for an Open Standard*

## Core hypothesis

It should be possible to transform architecture from descriptive guidance into a structured, machine-readable, and partially enforceable model.

## Initial motivation

Infrastructure as Code solved deployment reproducibility, but did not solve the architectural gap between:

- intent
- decisions
- implementation
- validation

This idea attempts to create a bridge between those layers.

## Initial focus

The first focus area is Security Architecture because it provides:

- stronger structure
- clearer constraints
- better traceability
- higher validation value

## Initial chain

A central conceptual chain in the model is:

Risk → Control Objective → Control → Implementation → Signal

This allows the model to connect architecture with deployed reality and verification.

Example:
- Risk: Privilege escalation via compromised admin endpoint
- Control Objective: Privileged access originates only from trusted devices
- Control: Privileged Access Workstation (PAW)
- Implementation: Azure VM with tag `role: PAW`
- Signal: Entra ID sign-in logs, Conditional Access logs

## Human and machine representation

Architecture should exist in two forms:

1. Structured model for processing and validation
2. Human-readable documentation for understanding

The model is canonical.
The human-readable document is a rendered projection of the model.

However, the document may also contain explicit commentary blocks written by humans.

These commentary blocks are intended for:

- rationale
- assumptions
- trade-offs
- caveats
- operational notes

They must not define mandatory architectural truth.
Canonical facts must remain in the model.

## Template direction

A practical starting point is to define architecture templates based on Microsoft guidance such as:

- CAF landing zones
- Zero Trust identity patterns
- PAW / privileged access controls
- Key Vault boundary patterns
- Conditional Access and PIM requirements

## Possible future directions

- architecture-to-IaC traceability
- baseline IaC generation from structured architecture
- drift detection
- compliance templates
- open template ecosystem
- extension from security architecture to broader infrastructure architecture

## Relationship to Existing Microsoft Capabilities

The solution does not replace:
- Azure Policy
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud
- Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark

Instead, it:
- references them
- structures them
- connects them to architecture decisions and IaC

## Open Standard Ambition

This proposal is not tied to a specific vendor, tool, or methodology.

The goal is to create an **Open Standard** for Architecture as Code that can be:
- Implemented by any organisation
- Rendered into any documentation format
- Validated against any IaC tool (initially Terraform, later others)

All contributions — to the model, the schema, or the validator — are welcome under the MIT license.

## Representation Layer

The architecture model is independent from its textual representation.

Different representation profiles can render the same model using:
- different terminology
- different document structures
- organization-specific formats

The initial implementation includes a single neutral representation.

## Coverage and Completeness

The system tracks which elements of the architecture model are represented in each document view.

Elements not included in a representation must be:
- explicitly excluded
- or marked as not yet represented

This ensures no architectural decisions or controls are silently omitted.
