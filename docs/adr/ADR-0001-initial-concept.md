## Context

Cloud architecture currently suffers from a structural disconnect between:

- architecture documentation
- architectural guidance
- IaC implementation
- deployed environment

This makes it difficult to preserve intent, validate compliance with architectural constraints, and detect drift.

## Decision
Explore the concept of **Architecture as Code (AaC)** that transforms architectural guidance, initially based on Microsoft CAF and Zero Trust, into structured templates and architecture models linked to implementation.

## Initial Scope

The first scope is Security Architecture.

The first implementation direction is:

- structured architecture model
- generated human-readable documentation
- explicit distinction between canonical architecture data and commentary
- mapping to implementation artifacts
- future validation against IaC

## Rationale

Security Architecture is a better starting point than full infrastructure because:

- it is more structured
- it is easier to trace from risk to implementation
- it has clearer constraints
- it is more naturally aligned with validation

## Consequences

This direction requires:

- a formal internal representation of architecture
- architecture templates
- traceability between model and implementation
- careful separation between canonical data and explanatory commentary
