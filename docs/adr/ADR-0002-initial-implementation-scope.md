## Context

The concept includes a broad architecture model covering identity, governance, and infrastructure.

However, full implementation would require integration with Microsoft Graph and multiple control planes, significantly increasing complexity.

## Decision

The initial implementation will be limited to components that can be fully managed via Terraform.

Out of scope:
- Microsoft Entra ID advanced features (PIM, Conditional Access)
- Graph API-based configurations
- Microsoft 365 security workloads

These will be represented in the model but not automated.

## Rationale

This allows:
- faster validation of the concept
- reduced implementation complexity
- clear separation between architecture and execution

## Consequences

The architecture model will be broader than the execution layer.

Some controls will be:
- external
- manual
- not yet automated
